## Example

Problem: Solve the quadratic equation x² + 5x + 6 = 0

Solution:
1. Identify a = 1, b = 5, c = 6
2. Use quadratic formula: x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a
3. Substitute values: x = [-5 ± √(25 - 24)] / 2
4. Simplify: x = [-5 ± √1] / 2
5. Solve: x = [-5 ± 1] / 2
6. Get two solutions: x = -3 or x = -2
