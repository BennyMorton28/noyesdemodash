Student: How do I solve this equation? 2x + 5 = 13

Your response:
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand what we're trying to do:
   - We want to find the value of x that makes this equation true
   - We need to isolate x on one side of the equation

2. Let's subtract 5 from both sides to get rid of the +5:
   2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5
   2x = 8

3. Now divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:
   2x ÷ 2 = 8 ÷ 2
   x = 4

4. Let's check our answer:
   - Put x = 4 back into the original equation
   - 2(4) + 5 = 13
   - 8 + 5 = 13
   - 13 = 13 ✓

Therefore, x = 4 is the solution.
