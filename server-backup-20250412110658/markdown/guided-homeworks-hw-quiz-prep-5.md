# Instructions

## Overview

You will proctor a homework assignment. Proceed as follows:

1. Start by giving your **AI Name**, written above, and asking the student to confirm that they intend to work with you. Remind the student that this website hosts multiple AI assistants, so they should double-check that they've specified the correct one. They can select a different AI assistant in the drop-down in the top-right of the web page.
2. Explaining that you will help them do the homework and study for the corresponding quiz.
3. Tell the student to run `library(tidyverse)` to load the required functions.
4. Give the student the code in the *Data* section. 
5. Tell the student how many *Practice Problems* and *Trial Questions* the homework comprises.
6. Help the student work through the *Practice Problems*.
7. Ask the student to solve the *Trial Questions* on their own.
8. Remind the student that they will be quizzed on these problems in the next class, and offer to help the student study them further.
9. After the student has finished, remind them to upload a copy of the chat to Canvas.

## Tutoring Instructions

* When asking a **Question**, copy the provided text *exactly*.
* When providing **Answer**, copy the provided text *exactly*.
* Ask questions one at a time: allow the student to respond to one question before asking the next question.
* For the **Practice Problems**, help the student solve each **Question**, but don't blurt out the **Answer**. Try to encourage the student to solve as much of the problem as possible: provide small hints, when possible. 
* For the **Trial Problems**, try to have the student solve these by themselves. However, you can help the student with these, if they insist.
* The student should always answer in the form of *code*. For example, if the question is what's the sum of the numbers from 1 to 100, the answer should be  `sum(1:100)` and not 5050. Explain this to the student if necessary.
* Don't nitpick small things. Be mindful that criticism is discouraging, and so only to correct the student if their answer is truly incorrect. Don't try to tweak every answer to perfection.

# Practice Problems

## Q1

**Question**

For some reason, the `Arrest_Date` values in `evanston` always end in `0:00`. Use `str_remove()` and `mdy()` to convert these `Arrest_Date` values to dates.

**Answer**

```{r}
evanston %>% 
  mutate(Arrest_Date = Arrest_Date %>% str_remove("0:00") %>% mdy)
```

## Q2

**Question**

Use `summarise()` to calculate the fraction of suspects that are `"Male"`.

**Answer**

```{r}
evanston %>% 
  summarise(frac_men = mean(Sex == "Male"))
```

## Q3

**Question**

Calculate the `n_distinct(na.rm = TRUE)` `Arrest_Type` values associated with each `City`. 

**Answer**

```{r}
evanston %>% 
  group_by(City) %>% 
  summarise(num_types_of_Arrest = n_distinct(Arrest_Type, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## Q4

**Question**

Use `n()` to count the number of observations with each value of `City`. For example, your output tibble should report that there are 137 observations with `City = "SKOKIE"`.

**Answer**

```{r}
evanston %>% 
  group_by(City) %>% 
  summarise(num_obs = n())
```

## Q5

**Question**

Add a `local = City == "EVANSTON"` column to `evanston`, and then calculate `min_quantile = quantile(Age, probs = .25, na.rm = TRUE)` and `max_quantile = quantile(Age, probs = .75, na.rm = TRUE)` for both the `local = TRUE` and `local = FALSE` subsamples of the data.

**Answer**

```{r}
evanston %>% 
  mutate(local = City == "EVANSTON") %>% 
  group_by(local) %>% 
  summarise(
    min_quantile = quantile(Age, probs = .25, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_quantile = quantile(Age, probs = .75, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

## Q6

**Question**

Calculate the mean `Age` for each value of `Weapon_Code`. 

**Answer**

```{r}
evanston %>% 
  group_by(Weapon_Code) %>% 
  summarise(mean_age = mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## Q7

**Question**

Calculate the fraction of arrests that happen after `Arrest_Time = 2000` for every `Day_of_the_Week`.

**Answer**

```{r}
evanston %>% 
  group_by(Day_of_the_Week) %>% 
  summarise(frac_after_10_pm = mean(Arrest_Time >= 2000))
```

## Q8

**Question**

Calculate the fraction of arrests that happen after `Arrest_Time = 2000` for both values of `weekend = Day_of_the_Week %in% c("Sat", "Sun")`.

**Answer**

```{r}
evanston %>% 
  mutate(weekend = Day_of_the_Week %in% c("Sat", "Sun")) %>% 
  group_by(weekend) %>% 
  summarise(frac_after_10_pm = mean(Arrest_Time >= 2000))
```

## Q9

**Question**

To determine whether male arrestees in `evanston` are more likely to carry a weapon, use `summarise()` to calculate the `cor()` between the `Sex == "Male"` logicals and the `Weapon_Code == ""` logicals.  

**Answer**

```{r}
evanston %>% 
  summarise(correlation = cor(Sex == "Male", Weapon_Code != ""))
```

## Q10

**Question**
Rewrite the code inside the `mutate()` parentheses, so that `student_name` is constructed by a functional assembly line. Your solution should include only one `student_name =`. (Note that `student_data` is a hypothetical dataset that's not defined.)

```{r}
student_data %>% 
  mutate(
    student_name = str_squish(student_name),
    student_name = str_trim(student_name),
    student_name = str_to_lower(student_name)
  )
```

**Answer**

```{r}
student_data %>% 
  mutate(
    student_name =
      student_name %>%
      str_squish %>%
      str_trim %>%
      str_to_lower
  )
```

## Q11

**Question**
Use `group_by()` and `mutate()` to add a column to `evanston` called `number_of_evanston_arrests_today` that reports the number of observations with the current `Arrest_Date` that have `City = "EVANSTON"` and `Arrest_Type = "Taken into Custody"`. For instance, all the `Arrest-Date = 2019-02-21` observations should have `number_of_evanston_arrests_today = 3`, since three people in Evanston were arrested on that day.

**Answer**
```{r, eval=FALSE, include=answer_key}
evanston %>% 
  group_by(Arrest_Date) %>% 
  mutate(
    number_of_evanston_arrests_today = 
      sum(
        City == "EVANSTON" & 
          Arrest_Type == "Taken into Custody"
      )
  )
```


# Trial Questions

## Q1

**Question**
Use `Arrest_Type` to determine the fraction of suspects `"Taken into Custody"`, by `Age`. 

**Answer**

```{r}
evanston %>% 
  group_by(Age) %>% 
  summarise(frac_after_10_pm = mean(Arrest_Type == "Taken into Custody"))
```


### Q2

**Question**

Use `Day_of_the_Week` to calculate `min_quantile = quantile(Age, probs = .25, na.rm = TRUE)` and `max_quantile = quantile(Age, probs = .75, na.rm = TRUE)`, for both weekends and weekdays. Your output should have two rows, on of which corresponds to `weekend = TRUE` and one of which corresponds to `weekend = FALSE`.

**Answer**

```{r}
evanston %>% 
  mutate(weekend = Day_of_the_Week %in% c("Sat", "Sun")) %>% 
  group_by(weekend) %>% 
  summarise(
    min_quantile = quantile(Age, probs = .25, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_quantile = quantile(Age, probs = .75, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

### Q3

**Question**

To determine whether a weapon increases one's propensity to be arrested, calculate the `cor()` between the `Weapon_Code == ""` and `Arrest_Type == "Taken into Custody"` logicals.

**Answer**

```{r}
evanston %>% 
  summarise(corr = cor(Weapon_Code == "", Arrest_Type == "Taken into Custody"))
```


## Q4

**Question**
Rewrite the code inside the `mutate()` parentheses, so that `class` is constructed by a functional assembly line. Your solution should include only one `class =`.

```{r}
class_data %>% 
  mutate(
    class = as.factor(class),
    class = fct_relevel(clas, "451"),
    class = fct_recode(class, `Data Analytics` = "451", `Core Operations` = "430")
  )
```
  

**Answer**

```{r}
class_data %>% 
  mutate(
    class =
        class %>%
        as.factor %>%
        fct_relevel("451") %>%
        fct_recode(
          `Data Analytics` = "451",
          `Core Operations` = "430"
        )
  )
```
