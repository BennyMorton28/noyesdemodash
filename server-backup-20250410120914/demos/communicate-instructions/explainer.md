# Communicate Complex Instructions

## Overview

Distributing an AI assistant is one of the best ways to communicate a complex set of instructions with your students. For example, I use this AI assistant to walk students through the process of setting up the two R projects they will need in my class. Creating these R projects is tricky, and in years past getting 60 students to create 120 R projects was trying and time consuming. Now I simply distribute this AI assistant, and the the class becomes quiet as all students independently work with the AI to create their projects. 

## Benefits Relative to the Professor

Shifting the explanatory burden from the faculty to the AI has several benefits. First, the AI buys you ten minutes of breathing room---a chance to drink some water and collect your thoughts. Second, a class is more engaging if the information is delivered through multiple channels: most students would prefer 80 minutes of content from their professor and 10 minutes from an AI agent than 90 minutes of content from their professor. Third, the AI frees up the professor to focus on the students who are really struggling. And fourth, the AI instruction can be taken offline. Thus, activities like this one can be used as flex time at the end of class---something the students could do in class, if there's time, and at time, otherwise. 

## Benefits Relative to a PDF

In theory, I could have distributed the project-creation instructions via a PDF. But this would have been impractical. First, in-class worksheets carry an unavoidable stigma---evoking memories of disengaged, apathetic teachers. In-class AIs do not carry this stigma---if anything, creating an AI agent for a class signals professor effort. Second, couching instructions in an AI can make them more manageable, as a long list of directives can be overwhelming. Indeed, to
avoid smothering the student with guidelines, I explicitly tell the AI to "Follow these steps sequentially. Let the student fully complete one step before proceeding to the next one." The AI agent focuses the student's attention on the next rung of the ladder, without drawing attention to the full height of the climb. Third, AI agents know a lot about the world, so they can usually fill-in details that you may have forgotten to include in your instructions. And fourth, AI agents can tailor their guidance to the student. For instance, if the full set of instructions comprises many special cases, then the AI can omit the details that are irrelevant for a given student, whereas a PDF forces them to wade through every one.
